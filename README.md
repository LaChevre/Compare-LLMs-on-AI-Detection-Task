# Comparing Large Language Models on AI Text Detection Tasks

## Introduction

This ongoing project investigates the capabilities of different Large Language Models (LLMs) in identifying papers generated by LLMs. The focus is on evaluating whether the significant cost associated with resource-intensive LLMs can be justified when compared to the deployment of smaller, more economical models. Current efforts include the application of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques to adapt these models more cost-efficiently.


## Models

The project investigates two main models for LLM detection:

- Bert: Known for its efficiency and cost-effectiveness, serving as the baseline model for comparison.
- Phi-2 with LoRA: Utilizing LoRA on Phi-2 to minimize computing costs.

The project also explored the possibility of using Mistral 7B, but the prohibitive computational demand led to a pivot towards more manageable models like Phi-2.
